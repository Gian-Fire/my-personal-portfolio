        This bot has been implemented into the SDCS slack workspace to improve the student experience.

        <p class='col-md-7 float-left'> 
          In our code school's slack workspace, we as students submit a daily stand up
          to the admins in order for them to track our progress through the curriculum.
          We are asked three questions daily that include: "What did you do since yesterday?", 
          "What will you do today?", and "Anything blocking your progress?".
        </p>
        <p class='col-md-7 float-left'>
          The answers we provide will also indicate to an instructor that we may need help
          in the following sections or that we are stuck on a paticular problem and need some insight.
          When a student enters the "/stanup" command in the SDCS workspace, they will be prompted with
          an interactive dialog as seen in the picture to the right.

        <p class='float-left'> 
          When a daily stand up is completed and submitted, the report will automatically be sent to 
          an private admin reports channel. At the same time, the student will be checked off the list 
          of students who need to turn in their daily stand up. 
        </p>
        <p class='float-left'>
          As an admin reads through the reported stand ups, they have the capability to 
          click on the student's name from the admin reports channel and message the student directly.
          This functionality allows the admin to give their input on a specific student's progress and 
          correct and problems that the student has reported.

      <div class='card-body'>
        <p class=' float-left'> 
          If a student forgets to submit their daily standup, a feature has been implemented to 
          remind the student to trigger, fill out and submit their daily stand up. The reminder is based
          off of a scheduled job function that tiggers when the server time reaches the schduled job time.
        </p>
        <p class=' float-left'>
          In the event that a student has not yet completed their standup for the day, they will receive 
          a message in the chat promting them to submit the report.

        <h4> Doorbell Command </h4>
      </div>
      <div class='card-body'>
        <p class='float-left'> 
          Same as the functionality that was implemented in the Send Reports feature, the 
          doorbell function previously had no indecation of who was ringing the doorbell. 
          Because the SDCS workspace is a public workspace, anyone who was signed in to our workspace had
          the ability to tigger these commands.
        </p>
        <p class='float-left'>
          The solution to this problem was to implement a list of current students who are confirmed 
          as enrolled. By doing this, we could identify the student using the "/doorbell" command and 
          open the door for them with a remote app. This feature added a level of security for the admins 
          and insturctors.
